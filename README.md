## Overview

Path Pilot is an intuitive tool for designing and guiding robotic paths. Create precise instructions
for your robot to follow a line, then export and upload these paths with ease. Monitor real-time
performance data, including IR sensor readings and motor speeds, to refine accuracy and ensure
optimal path-following. Perfect for robotics enthusiasts and developers looking to create, test, and
optimize robotic movement.
